## Hey there 👋

I'm **Kushal SG**, a software engineer based in India.  

I design and build backend systems and full-stack applications using **Java, Spring Boot, SQL and React**.  

I focus on creating practical solutions with clean, maintainable code. 

This is my space for projects, experiments, and continuous learning.  

Everything here is built from scratch—no templates or shortcuts.

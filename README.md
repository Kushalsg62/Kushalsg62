## Hey there 👋

I'm **Kushal SG**, a software engineer based in India.

I design and build projects using -- React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and a bit of animation with Framer Motion.

I also use Figma for UI design and Procreate when I want to sketch ideas.

This is a fresh profile where I'll be uploading some smaller projects, experiments, and things I'm currently working on. Everything
here is built from scratch, no copy-paste templates.
